        I'm a very ambitious front-end developer with good problem solving
        skills looking for a role in IT company with the opportunity to work
        with the latest technologies on challenging and diverse projects.

        improving my skills.

        If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a frendly
        person, lover of drawing, a sports fanatic, purposeful with a thirst for
        development.
